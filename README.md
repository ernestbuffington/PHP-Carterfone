# What is meant by federated database?
A federated database is a system in which several databases appear to function as a single entity. Each component database in the system is completely self-sustained and functional. A nonfederated database system is an integration of component DBMS that are not autonomous. A federated database system consists of component DBS that are autonomous yet participate in a federation to allow partial and controlled sharing of their data.
